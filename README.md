## Algorithm
This library contains some algorithms about machine learning and traditional algorithms.

#### Machine learning
The best way to learn machine learning algorithms is to realize them by oneself.It's the reason to write this library.This algorithms are to construct the mathematical model which can be used to classification and regression.

##### classification

* Simple KNN Model
    
    Iterative all samples to find the nearest point

* Naive Bayes Model
    
    Model can classify multi classes,the value of features can only be concrete
    
* PerceptronModel

* BinLogisticRegressionModel
    
    Binary logistic regression model
    
##### regression

* LinearRegression
    
##### cluster

* k-means
    
    Use k-means++ to initiate the means
